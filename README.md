  - Ask the following:
    - Join / merge the files together into a single table.
    - Data pre-processing; clean the data.
    - How much revenue did we generate in total and by campaign?
    - Which day we had the highest average visitors?
    - Which promotion costs us the most?
    - What is the weekly average revenue, visitors and marketing spend?
    - Plot the revenue and cost by week (see sql_task_plot.py)
- Present the data in a tableau dashboard.
